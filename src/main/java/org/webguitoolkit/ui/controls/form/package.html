In this package there are all FormControl and the Compound classes. 
</p>
<p>
FormControls are usually managed by a Compound, that means that they are 
filled by the compound and the value of the FormControl is stored to the 
business object by the compound. To manage a Compounds mode (new, edit, readonly)
the ButtonBar can be used.
